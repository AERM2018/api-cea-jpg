# API CEA

## Welcome to the API for the Control escolar "Alejandria".

#### The first thing is to get access to the URL which help you to start requesting data.
[BASE_URL]:URL: http://api.alejandria.edu.mx/api-ale/v1/

**Note:** Don't forget that you need a token to get the data, otherwise you won't be able to get it.

## Token and how to put in the headers

The token have to be in the request's headers, add a property called "x-token" to the headers object and there put your token.

In every request you'll have to add something like this:
```
fetch(URL, {
    method : 'GET',
    headers : {
        'x-token': 'Put here your token'
    },
    body : body
    ...
})

or

const myHeaders = new Headers();

myHeaders.append('x-token', 'Put here your token');

fetch(URL, {
    method : 'GET',
    headers : myHeaders,
     body : body
    ...
})
```

**Note:** The only endpoint that don't need token is the login



## Error handeling

The endpoints may respond an error due to several reasons. The errros may be display different info, the following examples are how they will look like:

```
{
    ok : false,
    msg : "Something went wrong, try again"
}
```
This kind of error most of the time has an code error *404* or *500*

*2)* When the request is sent, but the request does not have the right attributes or the attributes' validation failed the request's answer looks like this:
```
{
    "ok": false,
    "msg": "Ocurrio un error al procesar tu petición",
    "errors": {
        "edu_level": {
            "msg": "El nivel de eduación es obligatorio",
            "param": "edu_level",
            "location": "body"
        }
    }
}
```
All the errors will be in the object "errors" . Each attribute of the object will be the name of the attribute that failed, its value will be the info about it.
