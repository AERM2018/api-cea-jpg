# API CEA

## Welcome to the API for the Control escolar "Alejandria".

#### The first thing is to get access to the URL which help you to start requesting data.
URL: http://api.alejandria.edu.mx/api-ale/v1/

**Note:** Don't forget that you need a token to get the data, otherwise you won't be able to get it.

## Token and how to put in the headers

The token have to be in the request's headers, add a property called "x-token" to the headers object and there put your token.

In every request you'll have to add something like this:
```
fetch(URL, {
    method : 'GET',
    headers : {
        'x-token': 'Put here your token'
    },
    body : body
    ...
})

or

const myHeaders = new Headers();

myHeaders.append('x-token', 'Put here your token');

fetch(URL, {
    method : 'GET',
    headers : myHeaders,
     body : body
    ...
})
```

**Note:** The only endpoint that don't need token is the login

## Here is a list of the endpoint that you can consult and the neccesary parameters to do it.

**Don't forget you need the url in order to get access of any of the endpoints**
